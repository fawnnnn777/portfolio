# portfolio
web app where you can create your own portfolio

it all started when I decided that it was time to create my portfolio. When I was developing my portfolio I realized that I was 
just hard-coding all my information into the site and maybe it would be better to make it more dynamic, easy to edit, more impressive, etc. 

After thinking, I got the idea of doing a web app where ANYONE could write their information and the site would generate their portfolio.
